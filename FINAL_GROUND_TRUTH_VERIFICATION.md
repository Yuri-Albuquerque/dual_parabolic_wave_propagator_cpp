# Final Ground Truth Verification Report

## ✅ SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF GROUND TRUTH SOLVE_WV FUNCTION

This report confirms that the dual parabolic wave simulation has been successfully corrected to match the ground truth `solve_wv` function from the acoustic wave PDE solver.

### Key Corrections Applied

#### 1. Wave Equation Coefficients (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
```cpp
// Ground truth solve_wv coefficients - CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED
const double q0 = c * dt;                        // Damping coefficient
const double q1 = c * c * dt * dt;               // Source coefficient  
const double q2 = (c * dt / dx) * (c * dt / dx); // X-direction coefficient
const double q3 = (c * dt / dy) * (c * dt / dy); // Y-direction coefficient
```

#### 2. Boundary Conditions (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
```cpp
// Special handling for top boundary (i == 0) - MATCHES GROUND TRUTH
if (i == 0) {
    // Use only x-direction derivatives for top boundary
    double dxx = m_grid[i * gridSize + (j - 1)] - 2.0 * m_grid[index] + m_grid[i * gridSize + (j + 1)];
    // Special y-derivative: 2*(u(1,j) - u(0,j))
    double dzz = 2.0 * (m_grid[(i + 1) * gridSize + j] - m_grid[index]);
}
```

#### 3. Initial Conditions (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
```cpp
// Ground truth initial conditions - CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED
const double init_cond_u0 = 0.0;
const double init_cond_u1 = init_cond_u0 + m_config.timeStep * init_cond_u0;
std::fill(m_grid.begin(), m_grid.end(), static_cast<float>(init_cond_u1));
std::fill(m_previousGrid.begin(), m_previousGrid.end(), static_cast<float>(init_cond_u0));
```

#### 4. Finite Difference Scheme (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
```cpp
// Standard centered difference - MATCHES GROUND TRUTH
double dxx = m_grid[i * gridSize + (j - 1)] - 2.0 * m_grid[index] + m_grid[i * gridSize + (j + 1)];
double dzz = m_grid[(i - 1) * gridSize + j] - 2.0 * m_grid[index] + m_grid[(i + 1) * gridSize + j];
```

#### 5. Wave Equation Update Formula (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
```cpp
// Ground truth wave equation - CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED
newGrid[index] = static_cast<float>((
    -1.0 * (m_previousGrid[index] - 2.0 * m_grid[index]) +
    q0 * dampingFactor * m_previousGrid[index] +
    q1 * m_sourceGrid[index] +
    q2 * dxx +
    q3 * dzz
) / denominator);
```

## 🎉 CONCLUSION

The dual parabolic wave simulation now correctly implements the ground truth `solve_wv` function for the acoustic wave PDE:

**ρ∂²u/∂t² - η∂u/∂t + ∇·∇u = f**

Where:
- ρ is density (related to velocity field c = 1/√ρ)
- η is the damping function
- u is the wave field
- f is the source term

The simulation properly handles:
1. Wave propagation between two parabolic reflectors
2. Coincident focus points for optimal wave focusing
3. Correct boundary conditions and damping
4. CFL-stable time stepping
5. Proper wave equation discretization

The implementation is ready for accurate acoustic wave simulation between the dual parabolic reflector system.
