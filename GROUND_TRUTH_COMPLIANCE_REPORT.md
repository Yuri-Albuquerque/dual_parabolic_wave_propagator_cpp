# Ground Truth Compliance Report

This report validates that the dual parabolic wave simulation correctly implements
the ground truth `solve_wv` function from the acoustic wave PDE solver.

## Wave Equation Implementation

The corrected implementation matches the ground truth solve_wv function:

```cpp
// Ground truth coefficients
q0 = c * dt;
q1 = c * c * dt * dt;
q2 = (c * dt / dx) * (c * dt / dx);
q3 = (c * dt / dy) * (c * dt / dy);
```

## Test Results

- **CFL Compliance**: ✅ PASSED
- **Parabola Dimensions**: ✅ PASSED
- **Wave Equation Parameters**: ✅ PASSED
- **Boundary Conditions**: ✅ PASSED
- **Focus Point Placement**: ✅ PASSED

**Overall Result**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

## Parabola Specifications

- **Major Parabola**: 508mm diameter, 100mm from focus (umbrella, concave down)
- **Minor Parabola**: 200mm diameter, 50mm from focus (bowl, concave up)
- **Focus Points**: Coincident at origin (0, 0)
- **Wave Source**: Located at focus point for optimal wave propagation
