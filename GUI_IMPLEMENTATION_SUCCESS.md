## üõ†Ô∏è BUILD SYSTEM

### CMake Configuration
- **Console Build**: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`
- **X11 GUI Build**: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_X11=ON ..`
- **Qt GUI Build**: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_GUI=ON ..` (for future Qt6 environments)

### Build Options
```cmake
option(BUILD_GUI "Build with Qt GUI" OFF)      # Qt6 version
option(BUILD_X11 "Build with X11 GUI" OFF)     # X11 native version
# Default: Console version
```

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### X11 GUI Architecture
```cpp
class X11Visualizer {
    // Direct X11 window management
    // Real-time pixel-based wave field rendering
    // Color mapping: red = positive amplitude, blue = negative
    // Event handling for interactive controls
    // Status text overlay with simulation parameters
}
```

### Key Technical Achievements
1. **Stable Simulation Loop**: Single simulation instance reused for stability
2. **Amplitude Clamping**: Prevents numerical instability (max amplitude limits)
3. **Efficient Rendering**: Rectangle-based drawing for optimal X11 performance
4. **Memory Management**: Proper X11 resource cleanup and error handling
5. **Cross-platform Build**: CMake system supports multiple GUI backends
